I"ª<p>LibrePager is an idea that I have been working on for a couple of years now. Basically, it is a â€œpagerâ€ like the thing your dad carried in his pocket to get radio txt messages in the 1980s, only now using the magic of Lora Chirp Spread Spectrum Modulation and mesh networked transceivers, it can be a two way messaging system, that is independent of the telecoms and can be free, both as in beer and as in liberty.</p>
