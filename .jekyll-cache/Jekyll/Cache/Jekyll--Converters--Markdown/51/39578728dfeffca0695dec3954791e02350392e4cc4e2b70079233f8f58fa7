<p>The Touchscreen Testbed (TS_testbed) is a soldered breadboard designed to connect commercially available touchscreen dev boards to the target mcu dev board, the ESP32 Devkit V1 to test software.</p>

This is the Touchscreen Testbed populated with a ILI9341 resistive touchscreen and a ESP32 Devkit V1 (30 pin) dev board, ready to plug into your computer with a usb cable to download code and/or to power for testing.<br /></p>

<p>The easiest way to explain it is to send you to the excellent <a href="https://www.XTronical.com/esp32ili9341">XTronical tutorial for ILI9341 resistive touchscreen</a>.  Here’s another link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq5yPJbX_uk">YouTube video</a> demonstrating XTronical’s finished device.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the LibrePager  <a href="https://github.com/librepager/ESP32_Graphic_Testbed">ESP32_Graphic_Testbed</a> Code Repository.  This code was generated using Visual Code Studio with PlatformIO, to load test device.</p>
