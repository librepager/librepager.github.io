<p>The Touchscreen Testbed (TS_testbed) is a soldered breadboard designed to connect commercially available touchscreen dev boards to the target mcu dev board, the ESP32 Devkit V1 to test software.</p>

<p><img src="/img/pop_ts_tb_300.jpg" /><br />
This is the Touchscreen Testbed populated with a ILI9341 resistive touchscreen and a ESP32 Devkit V1 (30 pin) dev board, ready to plug into your computer with a usb cable to download code and/or to power for testing.<br /></p>
