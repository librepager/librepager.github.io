<p>Librepagers will be handheld messaging devices that can send encrypted text to each other without support from the internet or from telephone companies. These radios will send messages thru each other forming clusters of pagers in a mesh network with much greater range than any single pager. They will work off the grid and during disasters when cell towers are down. However, where connection to the Internet is available, LibrePager will use Internet Gateways both to contact other LibrePagers in distance clusters and to message conventional cell phones on the SMS texting system.</p>

<p>Librepager is social idea as well as a technical one. People who deploy gateways and repeaters for themselves will share their equipment with others, and all will benefit from the extended range and capacity. Ideally, nobody would gather metadata about other users and selling personally identifiable information would be prohibited. Finding ways to do that in harmony with a liberal open source software license will be a challenge.</p>

<h1 id="how-will-it-work">How Will it work</h1>

<p>LibrePagers will be specialized <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/about">Meshtastic</a> Radio devices with software extensions to make using Internet Gateways practical. Meshtastic radios are developed technology and are available now. They use LoRa radio protocols which have exceptionally good range and that use radio bands which don’t require operator and station licenses in most places.  The chief difference between Meshtastic and Librepager is that Meshtastic is intended to be used by outdoor enthusiasts like backpackers and paragliders, while LibrePager is for daily carry to supplement or replace cell phones for text messaging.</p>

<p>Connection to the SMS telephone network will use the <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> App’s command line interface. Peer to peer connections between LibrePagers thru Internet Bridges should be easier than that, but is yet to be designed.</p>

<h1 id="who-develops-librepager">Who develops LibrePager</h1>

<p>Right now there a only one principal developer devoting time every week to LibrePager, although several others have made significant hardware and software contributions.   If you would like to donate your time and skills to the effort, it would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I apologize for using the pseudonyms <em>Mongo</em> and <em>Info</em> to maintain anonymity, but it is a practical necessity of life on the Internet.  If we do business, I look forward to getting to know you personally.</p>

<h1 id="what-will-success-look-like">What will success look like</h1>

<p>One measure of success would be that ordinary people could use LibrePager to go miles from their homes and still text each other while their smart phones sit at home on their desk.  Widespread adoption of the technology would be greater success.  I am looking forward to stemming the constant leak of my own personal information that goes hand in hand with using a smartphone. That may be the sweetest success of all.</p>
