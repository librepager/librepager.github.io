I"<p>The technology that I am immersed now is coding for user interface (UI) on touchscreens. (Actually, learning to blog in HTML and Jekyll has filled up my spare time for a few weeks, but UI editing is the technical focus. )  Touchscreen is clearly the hardware of choice for humans to control compact handheld radios. You can create any kind of specialized keyboard or RF controls you want in software, and then switch to a screen filled with text I/O. Techies that work on devices like these should never lose sight of the fact that, “As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product”. (Jef Raskin, <em>The Human Interface</em> 2001)  I believe that the quality of this user interface will make or break LibrePager as a useful technology. I intend to get it right.</p>
