I"-<p>The technology that I am immersed now is coding for user interface (UI) on touchscreens. (Actually, learning to blog in HTML and Jekyll has filled up my spare time for a few weeks, but UI editing is the technical focus. )  Touchscreen is clearly the hardware of choice for humans to control compact handheld radios. You can create any kind of specialized keyboard or RF controls you want in software, and then switch to a screen filled with text I/O. Techies that work on devices like these should never lose sight of the fact that, “As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product”. (Jef Raskin, <em>The Human Interface</em> 2001)  I believe that the quality of this user interface will make or break LibrePager as a useful technology. I intend to get it right.</p>

<p>As of this date, I have ported the LVGL Library to ESP32 dev boards in hardware.  I have used simulator provided by LVGL (LVGL PC Simulator using Visual Studio) to write a preliminary version of a graphic user interface, similar to Android SMS texting user interface, to enter the messages and display the conversations. It needs improvement. I will be adapting it for use in hardware on the Touchscreen Testbed to demo the interface in an app called the IOT-Terminal.</p>

<p>Although the LVGL Library is open source, it isn’t exactly non-commercial. The developers accurately recognized that an open source software license would make their product very attractive. So LVGL has been released under the MIT License. The developer’s business model is to make their money by charging their users for support. This leads to a situation where this open source technology has fairly good documentation, but only up to a point.</p>

<p>When I started coding for the above user interface, LVGL offered the public a service to provide code for up to 5 screens for one hardware device for $5,000. More recently, the LVGL developers are promoting a new “User Interface Editor” software called SquareLine Studio. You can download it and use it for free for 30 day, and after that, it costs about $12 per month per computer for non-commercial uses, and about $120 for commercial use. I have tried it and it seems OK, although it is early in its development cycle (It was released 2 months ago in Jan 2022.) Clearly, you can use the LVGL library to write code that works without their editor, but the learning curve is steep.</p>

<p>LVGL does work pretty well and it has the right license. It has the potential to be installed on many small microcontrollers, ESP32, a core MCU for Meshtastic, among them. I intend to learn the Squareline Studio editor.  Hopefully, the code automatically generated will be better than the code I have been making by hand. I don’t know if the staff at LVGL will have time to support their non-commercial clients, but we’ll see.</p>
