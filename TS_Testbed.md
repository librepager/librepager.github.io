# How Will it work

LibrePagers will be specialized [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/docs/about) Radio devices with software extensions to make using Internet Gateways practical. Meshtastic radios are developed technology and are available now. They use LoRa radio protocols which have exceptionally good range and that use radio bands which don't require operator and station licenses in most places.  The chief difference between Meshtastic and Librepager is that Meshtastic is intended to be used by outdoor enthusiasts like backpackers and paragliders, while LibrePager is for daily carry to supplement or replace cell phones for text messaging. 

Connection to the SMS telephone network will use the [Signal](https://signal.org/en/) App's command line interface. Peer to peer connections between LibrePagers thru Internet Bridges should be easier than that, but is yet to be designed.
